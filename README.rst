Content Related Images
======================


This packages add a behavior to manage content related images.
This is done with a RelationList field.
If plone.app.widgets is installed, the RelationList is finally usable ;)

Images are shown in a viewlet (activated in IBelowContentTitle)
If `pat-upload`_ (mockup) is installed, you can drag'n'drop images to your
content easily.
