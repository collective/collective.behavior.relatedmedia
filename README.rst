Content Related Images/Attachments
==================================

This packages adds a behavior to manage content related images and attachments.
This is done with a RelationList field.
If plone.app.widgets is installed, the RelationList is finally usable ;)

Images are shown in a viewlet (activated in IBelowContentTitle)

Attachments are also shown in a viewlet (activated in IBelowContentBody)

If `pat-upload`_ (mockup) is installed, you can drag'n'drop images to your
content easily.
